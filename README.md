# Introduction
A 3D-printed, low-mass steering wheel for a racing simulator. Low mass and inertia matter when relying on the wheel’s self-centering forces during hands-off drifting, since most sim wheelbases have limited torque.

The steering wheel has a standard 6-hole racing mounts with a 70 mm pitch circle diameter.

# BoM
For assembling the steering wheel you need:
 * 9x DIN 912 M5 15 mm screws
 * 9x brass heatset insert M5 (diameter 5.8 mm, height 7.1 mm)
 * 6x M5 screws for your wheelbase's mount

# Assembly

The renders should be self-explanatory.
